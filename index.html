        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Kyle Yasumiishi. I am a Senior Financial Analyst who loves tech. My passions include financial modeling, computers, coding, video games, tech, food and fitness.

        <h2>Goals of this project</h2>
        <p>
            I used to be a pretty decent self-taught web developer, but haven't built any new projects recently. This project will be a web app that allows a user to log in and add microgoals, defined as tasks that take 10 minutes or less, that users can add for four different areas of their lives: health, self, work, and relationships. The user will be able to add microgoals and mark tasks as completed.  
        </p>
        <p>
            My main goals for buiding this app include:
            <ol>
                <li>Refresh my knowledge on HTML and CSS</li>
                <li>Build a couple mini apps that will help me build this larger app</li>
                <li>Build a full-stack app</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h2>Technologies</h2>
        <p>I expect to use the following technologies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>Flask</li>
            <li>Git</li>
        </ul>
